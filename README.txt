Why did you read me?

Let's just add another text and commit it then upload it again.

Aww yeaahh!! now we know how to commit it to github :D

First is you commit it then you push it. right? right?

Ok it's wrong.

First you need to add the file. 
git add README.txt
then commit it
git commit -m "fifth commit"
then you push it
git push -u origin master

I think this should work now
